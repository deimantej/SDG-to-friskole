                    <h2>School history:</h2> <br>
                   <p></p>
                
                   The school opened as a Free School in August 1992 following the closure of the local municipal school. From the beginning there were 80 children, 7 teachers and a secretary, but with a growing number of children in the area and good external connections, the number of pupils has grown steadily, so we have 144 children from 99 families in 2013. Our SFO has 66 enrolled students from 0-3. class and Nature Kindergarten Engen holds between approx. 36 and up to approx. 50 children. It depends on the season. In August, when the oldest kindergarten children have just started school, the number of children is correspondingly lowest. 
                   
                   The school's buildings are owned by the Support Association, and parents and other members of the association have put a lot of work into renovating and expanding the school.
                   
                   <br>   <br> In 1993, the house was built in the schoolyard, in 1995 the old teacher's residence - No. 47, which was converted into two classrooms was purchased and in 1997 the new kindergarten class / SFO building was added.
                   
                   Later, two rooms were expanded over the dressing rooms. They were put into service in August 2000.
                   
                   In 2004, the largest expansion to date was put into operation. It was the school aula that is used diligently every day by all students and teachers, for morning gathering, reading room, teaching, storytelling, film screening, parties ..... in short: what would we do without our aula?
                   
                   Finally, the natural kindergarten Engen was added in 2008.   <br>   <br> 
                   
                   In 2012, the Support Association was able to inaugurate MOT Multi - a mutihal which contains: an entire handball hall with a trench, changing facilities, 3 large, bright classrooms with direct access to the outdoor space, Folkekitchen, which acts as a school kitchen during school hours. Free School, Kindergarten and SFO have these formidable facilities on all weekdays from 2pm. 8.00 to 15.00. Then MOT Multi is used by a wealth of associations with offers in various sports, cooking courses, etc. - yes, only the imagination sets the limit. 
                   
                   Our physics room and handicraft / visual arts have also been renovated and expanded in recent years, so the professional rooms now appear as contemporary and optimal in terms of teaching.
                   
                   In addition, there are a number of larger and smaller projects in and around the school, which the support association is also behind. These have been demanding tasks, but have also helped to strengthen the unity around the Free School.
                   
                   <br>   <br> Free school and local school.
                   The Mejls Free School is a locally based school, and the Board of Directors has decided that we must provide space for the children from the old Mejls-Orten-Tingh√∏j school district.
                   
                   We aim for a class size of about 20 students.
